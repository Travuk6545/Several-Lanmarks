         <h1 class="f-light">Big-Ben tower</h1>
         <p class="lead text-muted">This is Big-Ben clock tower that located in London.
          Big Ben is one of the most iconic landmarks in London, universally recognized as a symbol of the United Kingdom. However, there's a common misconception about what "Big Ben" actually refers to.
         </p> 
         <h2>What is "Big Ben"?</h2>
         <p>Strictly speaking, Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell inside the clock tower, which weighs a massive 13.7 tonnes (over 13 tons). It's the largest of the five bells in the tower. The origin of the nickname is debated, with theories suggesting it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw the construction, or a famous heavyweight boxer of the time, Benjamin Caunt.</p>
         <h3>The Tower's Official Name:</h3>
         <p>For many years, the tower itself was simply known as The Clock Tower. However, in 2012, to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, it was officially renamed the Elizabeth Tower. Despite this, most people, both in the UK and globally, still colloquially refer to the entire structure as Big Ben.

Key Facts about the Elizabeth Tower:

Construction: The tower was built as part of Charles Barry's design for the new Palace of Westminster after the original palace was largely destroyed by fire in 1834. Construction began in 1843 and it was completed in 1859. Augustus Pugin was responsible for the Gothic Revival design of the tower.

Height: The Elizabeth Tower stands at 96 meters (316 feet) tall.

Clock Faces: There are four clock faces, each with a diameter of 7 meters (22.5 feet). They are made up of 324 pieces of pot opal glass in a cast iron frame.

Hands: The minute hands are 4.2 meters (14 feet) long and weigh 100 kg, while the hour hands are 2.7 meters (9 feet) long and weigh 300 kg.

Accuracy: The Great Clock is renowned for its accuracy. It uses a unique "double three-legged gravity escapement" designed by Edmund Beckett Denison to ensure precision, even accounting for external pressures like wind. Its accuracy is adjusted by adding old pre-decimal pennies to the pendulum â€“ each penny causes the clock to gain two-fifths of a second in 24 hours.

Bells: Besides Big Ben, there are four smaller quarter bells that chime the Westminster Quarters melody every 15 minutes. The bells are fixed in place and struck by hammers from the outside.

Inscriptions: At the base of each clock dial, there's a Latin inscription that reads: "Domine Salvam fac Reginam nostram Victoriam primam" ("O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First").

Restoration: The tower underwent extensive conservation work from 2017 to 2022, during which Big Ben's chimes were largely silenced to protect workers, only ringing for special occasions. It resumed its regular striking schedule in November 2022.

The Elizabeth Tower, with Big Ben inside, remains a powerful symbol of British democracy and resilience, an enduring architectural and engineering marvel that has witnessed centuries of history from its prominent position on the River Thames.</p>
